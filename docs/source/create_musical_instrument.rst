Programming with Scratch 3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the left of Scratch 3 main page are some neatly arranged blocks with which you can drag to program. In this project, we need to add in other two functions: Music and Raspberry Pi GPIO. The Music function to play instruments and drums, and the Raspberry Pi GPIO function can be used to control the whole pins of Raspberry Pi.

Build the Circuit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First connect the GPIO Extension Board, please read :ref:`GPIO Extension Board` for specific steps.

Insert the T-type GPIO extension board into the breadboard and build the circuit as shown below.

Programming with Scratch 3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the left of Scratch 3 main page are some neatly arranged blocks with which you can drag to program. In this project, we need to add in other two functions: Music and Raspberry Pi GPIO. The Music function to play instruments and drums, and the Raspberry Pi GPIO function can be used to control the whole pins of Raspberry Pi.
